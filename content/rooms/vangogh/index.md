The Van Gogh image of the Yellow House assisted in creating the colors and light found in this room.

It has a king size bed, skylights in an open-beam wooden ceiling, and a clawfoot tub with shower. This room has a view of the ocean through the pinetrees.

_Please note that this room is on the second floor, and is only accessible by staircase._
