Georgia O'Keefe, the famous female artist, was born in New York, but spent most of her adult life in New Mexico. The southwest influence is visible in her artwork, and in the design of the room.

The Georgia O'Keefe room is done in Santa Fe style with a queen size bed and a twin day bed built in. It has a beautiful tile walk-in shower and a back deck with a garden view.
