Frederic Remington was an American painter, illustrator, and sculptor, who specialized in depictions of the Old West.

The Remington room is done in western style, has two double beds, a bath-shower combination, and a Remington bronze Bronco Buster statue in the entryway. There is a small ocean view from the back deck and a view of the garden.
